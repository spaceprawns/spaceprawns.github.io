# Project Plan
## Project Vision
We want to create a web app that allows users to search a GitHub project and obtain information on the contributions of each team member, to aid assignment markers and managers to track projects easily.

## Process Model and explanation
**Why are we using the Scrum model for our project, and what are we changing?**
Our team will be basing our process model off the Scrum model. The Scrum process model is an agile process framework which emphasises flexibility; and a cross-functional and self-managing team. For the most part, our team will stick to the official scrum model. To summarise, we will establish a product backlog at inception. In sprint planning, the team and product owner will select prioritised product backlog items and allocate them to the current sprint backlog. Our sprints will be 2 weeks long. During each sprint, the team will conduct standup meetings twice weekly and at the end of the sprint, the product backlog refinement, sprint reviews and retrospectives will be performed. Following this, sprint planning will commence for the next sprint. However due to the constraints of this project, there will be some changes to this process. 
These changes are:
  - The Scrum master role is usually a dedicated full-time role. However, due to the size of our team (5), a ‘team member’ will also play the role of the Scrum Master.
  - Instead of the ‘daily scrum’, we will have stand-up meetings twice weekly (one in labs, one outside of the labs). For our circumstances, meeting everyday is impractical so we have reduced it to twice weekly with constant communication through online platforms.
  - Sprint meetings will be significantly shorter than recommended by the official Scrum model because of the smaller scale of our project. 

## Time Management
Timeline of project will be tracked through Facebook messenger reminders and Asana.

**Policies**
  - Sprint backlog must be put into Asana at the planning stage of each sprint
  - Each task must have a deadline
  - Once a component in the sprint backlog has been completed, the team member(s) must check this off in Asana
  - If a deadline is not reached, a team meeting needs to be conducted to re-schedule the task and evaluate what should be changed for next time
  - Tasks must be independent of each other

**Task Allocation**
Before the beginning of each sprint, we will organise a team meeting in which tasks in the sprint backlog will be listed. Each team member will be able to put down their preference for each task and then tasks will be divided amongst members according to team member’s individual skill sets, roles, responsibilities and preferences.

**Task Tracking**
Platforms such as GitKraken and GoogleDrive will be used to track tasks. Through GitKraken, team members will be able to work collaboratively and view each other’s progress. A time log spreadsheet which will be updated by team members in our shared Google Drive will also help keep track of tasks.

## Definition of Done
The project will produce accurate data for any GitHub project online. The project will be  easy to access anywhere, anytime, on any platform. A meeting will be held to obtain the approval and satisfaction of all stakeholders.

**Definition of Done for a feature**
  - The source code follow standards/convention.
  - Unit testing has been conducted and completed for the responsible component.
  - Document related to the feature is recorded.
  - Review with team and product owner

**Definition of Done for a sprint**
  - All components of the sprint backlog have been implemented.
  - Product review has been conducted with the product owner.
  - All team members have attended a retrospective meeting.
 
**Definition of Done for a release**
  - Completed all features of the product backlog
  - Conducted acceptance testing with the product owner and team
  - QA is done and all issues resolved
  - Environment (web-hosting) is prepared for release
  - No defects
